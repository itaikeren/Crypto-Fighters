# Crypto Fighters
## INTRODUCTION

We were asked to create a system based on a smart contract that will be host on the Ethereum blockchain network. The system we have created is a concept of the famous system "Crypto Katies".
The system allows each account holder to create a warrior and fight the fighters of other account holders.


## COMPLETED TASKS

- Building the smart contract
- Creating a Payable function in the smart contract
- Host the smart contract on the Ethereum test Blockchain network
- Connect to the smart contract with Web3
- Creating a friendly UI client

## FUTURE PLANS

- Create more advanced UI client
- Create more advanced fighter image system based on the fighter DNA number

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Download all the project files ([GitHub link](https://github.com/itaikeren/Crypto-Fighters))
